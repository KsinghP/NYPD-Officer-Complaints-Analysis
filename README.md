# NYPD-Officer-Complaints-Analysis
This project is based on a data set containing complaints filed against currently serving NYPD officers. The source is: https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers

Each row of the data lists a complaint, and the columns include various details on officers (name, race, age, gender, month and year of incident, rank at the time of incident, current rank) and complainants (race, age, gender) as well as other details such as reason why the officer made contact, the outcome of contact, and the findings of NYPD's disciplinary board (classified as Unsubstantiated/Exonerated/Substantiated). It's noteworthy that NYPD can choose to ignore the recommendations of the board.

The code is divided into 10 different parts/sections, each of which unearths interesting insights from the data. Some of those are mentioned below:
